TO RUN:
java -jar blackjack.jar

repl blackjack implementation without surrender or insurance. Code is modular and can allow for arbitrary implementations of the player (an example is the robot player, created by naming a player with the string 'robot' in it, which takes random actions and 1 dollar bets). Current implementation does not allow resplitting but code could easily change to allow this.
